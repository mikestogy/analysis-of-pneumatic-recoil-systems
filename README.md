# gas-blowback-recoil-kinetics

GOAL/OVERVIEW

The goal of the project is to collect information on the kinetic behavior of the primary operating mechanisms that drive various gas blowback hobby rifle platforms. While not identical to their real life counterparts, gas blowback hobby rifles serve as a more approachable platform to investigate and quantify fundemental principals of phyiscs and engineering that require more demanding experimental setups. Compiling this data allows for the creation of a performance profile, enabling comparison and facilitating the ongoing development and improvement of a given platform. Typically, manufacturers omit this information, leading consumers to rely on subjective and sometimes conflicting information found online. By attempting to quantify both subjective and objective attributes of a platform, we aim to establish a benchmark that can serve as a reference for recomendations and troubleshooting. This data-driven approach strives to provide objective insights and valuable guidance for users, promoting transparency and informed decision-making.

An automated and configurable experimental setup with accompanying software means this system is not only able to provide detail about a single shot, but also provide detail over a series of shots defined by adjustable paramaters, executed with machine level precision. Removing the human factor while controlling as many variables as possible allows us to create an accurate and detailed performance profile of the platform. The performance profile of the platform will, initially, consist of two major categories - kinetic performance and propellant efficiency.

Kinetic performance will be assessed by precicesly measuring the time it takes for the main pneumatic mechanism to complete various stages of its motion. Impulse resulting from the primary recoil action will also be measured by precise force sensing circuitry. Combining this information with known variables such as the total recriprocating mass, distance it travels, and the mass of the entire platform allows us to understand the flow of energy through the system over time.

Propellant efficiency will be analyzed by controlling the compound, mass quantity, and temperature of the propellant used. By controlling these variables and analyzing the resultant kinetic behavior, we can help users decide not only what kind of propellant, but how much propellant to use in a given environment. Subjective experiences such as 'snappieness' and 'cooldown' can also begin to be quantified. In this context, snappieness refers to how long it takes for the bulk of the recoil impulse to be imparted into the platform and thus, the user. Generally, a faster delivery of recoil impulse, even if the average force is less, is more desireable. Cooldown refers to both the cooling as a result endothermic reactions taking place inside the system and the increase in blowback time. While these two effects are directly related, its important to appreciate that more abosolute cooling does not necessarily mean more 'cooldown'.

SCOPE

Initially, the only platform being tested is the GHK AKS74U. In its current configuration, the experimental setup is only equiped to measure this platform. In the future, this will be made to accept as many platforms as possible.

Eventually, we hope to measure muzzle energy from fired 6mm projectiles, but as of now, this is not part of the scope of the project. While indeed a big assumption, for now, we are just assuming that a consistent kinetic behavior will result in a consistent projectile behavior.

Ultimatley the purpose is to contextualize user experiences in a more meaningful way. Secondarily, the information can be used to develop and validate components for platforms. For example, is a DIY nozzle replacement as good or better than a stock one?

ABOUT V0.1 DATA

V0.1 was the first version of this project, dubbed 'krink dyno'. It was more a proof of concept than anything, many asterisks next to that data that makes it not exactly relevant, but nonetheless proves some points that influence the approach to the new version of the project.
